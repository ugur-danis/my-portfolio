    "title": "About Me",
    "intro": "Hello, I'm Uğur. I've been developing software for over 4 years; sometimes someone who stares at the screen for hours, sometimes someone who saves (or completely breaks) the world with a single line of code.",
    "experience": "From mobile applications to web interfaces, from backend services written with Node.js to simple but smooth user experiences, my hands have touched code in many areas. I love creating user-centered, simple but functional work. My goal is 'it works and it's beautiful' rather than 'it works but it's not beautiful'.",
    "passion": "I love exploring new technologies, writing clean code, and saying 'that's it' to myself when I solve a problem.",
    "summary": "In short: I'm a developer who feels design, loves code, and cares about details.",
